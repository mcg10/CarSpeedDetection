# CarSpeedDetection
This repository contains a codebase that attempts to estimate vehicle speeds on a Raspberry Pui with a computer-vision based approach. The system utilizes MobileNet-SSD for object detection and centroid and correlation tracking as tracking algorithms. This work was completed for Duke's ECE 654 Edge Computing Course
